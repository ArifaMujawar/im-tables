# A structural type for detecting queries.
# This is a structural type and not an instance-of type
# because this library will support external provision
# of queries (possibly constructed with different classes)
# and it would be good to support mocking more easily too.
#
# The selected properties do not represent the full public
# API of these classes, but they should be more than enough to
# positively identify instances of them with a very low chance
# of false positives, and zero false negatives.
