# This module provides logic for finding formatters registered for specific
# paths.  The semantics are that formatters are functions that are used to
# format a cell, and these are registered for one or more fields of an object.
# e.g: A formatter may handle ChromosomeLocation objects, but only handle the
# .start and .end fields, leaving .strand alone. In this case then the format
# set should have an entry at 'ChromosomeLocation' for the formatter, and one
# at 'ChromosomeLocation.start' and 'ChromosomeLocation.end' each with the
# value `true`, indicating that the formatter is to be looked up by class name.
# If on the other hand the formatter is meant to handle all paths, then a
# short-cut of 'ChromosomeLocation.*' can be used, which will match against all
# paths. As a convenience, the formatter can also be registered at that key,
# rather than needing a second lookup.
#
# This module manages a formatter registry, wrapped in a NestedModel, providing
# accessors to find appropriate formatters and register new ones.
